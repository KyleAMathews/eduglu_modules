// Fix outgoing emails, get feature menu working, logout, set variable to make the primary menu use the feature menu
* set frontpage as the homepage
* Comment settings -- do this inside features w/ strongarm
* enable user picture -- probably with the imagecache user picture module


TODO figure out why install breaking on spaces -- see openatrium/managing news, slim down uprofile, remove byu logo somehow, set variables so things work by default
 *  i.e. set group as an og group node, stop querying for realname, just use realname's stuff, pick appropriate roles to create
 
 
* fix outgoing emails
* slim down profile to minimum -- kill the connect stuff until have a better solution
* figure out how to get pictures working
* change logo to just say eduglue
* fix comment options
* Change any strings to eduglue - or the site name
* user pictures not showing in posts/comments
